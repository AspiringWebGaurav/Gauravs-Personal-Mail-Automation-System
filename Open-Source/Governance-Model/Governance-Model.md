## Governance Structure

If GPMAS transitions to open source, governance will follow a **Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)** model:

| Role | Responsibility | Holder |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **BDFL / Project Lead** | Final decision authority on all technical and strategic matters | Gaurav Patil |
| **Maintainers** | Code review, issue triage, release management | Appointed by BDFL |
| **Contributors** | Code, documentation, and community participation | Open (with CLA) |

---

## Decision-Making Process

1. **Routine decisions** (bug fixes, minor improvements) — maintainer discretion
2. **Significant changes** (new features, architecture changes) — BDFL review required
3. **Strategic decisions** (license changes, governance changes) — BDFL authority only
4. **Community input** — welcomed through issues and discussions; advisory, not binding

---

## Principles

- **Transparency** — decisions are documented with reasoning
- **Meritocracy** — contribution quality determines influence
- **Stability** — reliability is never sacrificed for velocity
- **Respect** — all participants are treated with professional courtesy
