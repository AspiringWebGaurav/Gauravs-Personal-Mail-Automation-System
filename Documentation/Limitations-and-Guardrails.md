## Overview

GPMAS V1 is designed as a high-reliability personal mail scheduling system. As with any software system, it operates within defined boundaries and constraints. This document transparently describes the current limitations and protective guardrails of the platform.

---

## 📋 Current Limitations

### 1. Requires at Least One Active Provider

GPMAS cannot send any emails without at least one active email delivery provider configured in the system. If no providers are registered, the system will:

- Prevent new invitations from being created
- Pause all queue processing
- Display a clear notification instructing the admin to add a provider

**Mitigation:** The system performs a provider availability check before every critical operation, ensuring clear and immediate feedback.

---

### 2. V1 Single-User Constraint

GPMAS V1 is designed for **single-owner operation**. Access is restricted exclusively to one pre-authorized Google account.

- Only the authorized owner can log in
- All API endpoints enforce this restriction independently
- There is no multi-user access, team collaboration, or delegated administration in V1

**Implication:** This is a deliberate design decision for V1 to ensure security simplicity. Multi-user support may be considered for future versions.

---

### 3. External Provider Dependency

GPMAS relies on third-party email delivery services (external providers) to send emails. The system does not operate its own mail servers.

- **Delivery speed** depends on the responsiveness of the external provider
- **Delivery success** depends on the external provider's infrastructure and uptime
- **Quota limits** are imposed by the external provider, not by GPMAS itself

**Mitigation:** The multi-provider architecture and automatic fallback reduce the impact of any single provider's issues. However, if all providers experience simultaneous outages, delivery will be paused until at least one recovers.

---

### 4. No Guarantee of Third-Party Uptime

While GPMAS is engineered for reliability, it cannot guarantee the uptime or availability of third-party services it depends on, including:

- Email delivery providers
- Authentication services (Google Sign-In)
- Cloud hosting infrastructure

**Mitigation:** The system is designed to degrade gracefully. Provider failures trigger automatic fallback, and all operations are queued for retry when services recover.

---

### 5. Invite Expiration Behavior

Invitation links generated by GPMAS are **time-limited** and expire after **24 hours** from creation.

- Expired invitation links display a clear "This invitation has expired" message
- Expired invitations cannot be accepted — a new invitation must be sent
- The system automatically updates the status of expired invitations

**Rationale:** This is a security measure to prevent stale invitation links from being used indefinitely.

---

### 6. Transaction Size Limit

When deleting an event, GPMAS performs an atomic transaction that removes the event and all associated data (participants, invitations, mail queue jobs). This transaction is limited to **500 document operations**.

- Events with an extremely large number of associated records may not be deletable in a single operation
- The system provides a clear error message if this limit is exceeded

**Implication:** For typical personal use, this limit is unlikely to be reached. It is a constraint of the underlying database platform.

## 🛡️ Protective Guardrails

### Authentication Guard
Every protected page and API endpoint independently verifies that the requesting user is the authorized owner. Unauthorized access is denied at every boundary.

### Zero-Provider Guard
The system refuses to create invitations or process the mail queue if no email providers are configured, preventing operations that cannot succeed.

### Global System Halt
An emergency stop mechanism that instantly pauses all email processing. Can be activated and deactivated from the Settings page.

### Duplicate Prevention
Multiple layers of deduplication at the invitation, acceptance, and email delivery levels prevent any operation from being executed twice.

### Distributed Locking
Critical operations (such as invite creation) use a locking mechanism to prevent conflicting concurrent operations, even under high-load conditions.

### Quota Awareness
The system tracks each provider's daily usage against its quota and automatically excludes providers that have reached their sending limit.

### Audit Trail
Every significant operation is logged with full diagnostic context, providing an immutable record for compliance and troubleshooting.
