## Vision

To establish a reference standard for personal mail automation — a system so reliable that professional email communications require no manual intervention, no uncertainty, and no blind spots.

---

## Mission

Build and maintain a production-grade mail automation platform that:

1. **Eliminates single points of failure** in email delivery through intelligent multi-provider orchestration
2. **Provides complete operational transparency** through real-time tracking and financial-grade audit logging
3. **Enforces security without friction** through single-owner access controls, cryptographic tokens, and atomic transactions
4. **Scales gracefully** from personal use to enterprise-ready architecture without fundamental redesign
5. **Maintains legal and ethical compliance** through a comprehensive framework of policies, terms, and usage guidelines

## Strategic Pillars

### Reliability Engineering
Every architectural decision is evaluated through a reliability lens. The question is never "will this work?" but "what happens when this fails?" — and the answer must always be: the system recovers automatically.

### Operational Excellence
Zero ambiguity in system state. The administrator should never wonder "did that email send?" — the Sent Tracker, audit trail, and provider health dashboard eliminate operational blind spots entirely.

### Security by Design
Security is not a layer added after the fact. It is woven into every boundary: authentication guards on every route, authorization checks on every API, cryptographic hashing on every token, and atomic transactions on every critical write.

### Sustainable Engineering
GPMAS is designed to operate within defined resource boundaries. The Burn Monitor tracks consumption against platform limits, predictive forecasting identifies potential overruns before they occur, and the system degrades gracefully under resource pressure.

## Long-Term Direction

| Horizon | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **V1 (Current)** | Single-tenant reliability, multi-provider resilience, complete observability |
| **V2 (Planned)** | Multi-user access with role-based permissions, enhanced analytics |
| **V3 (Exploratory)** | API access layer, integration ecosystem, potential open-source transition |
