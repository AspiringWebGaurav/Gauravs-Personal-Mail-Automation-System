## 📐 Documentation Design Principles

**Why is documentation deeply structured?**  
Shallow documentation creates ambiguity. Each document covers one topic with layered depth (what → why → how → failures → business implications → boundaries). This makes information findable and reviewable independently.

**Why are folders separated?**  
Separation of concerns. Legal documents are reviewed by legal teams, not engineers. Architecture documents are reviewed by architects, not investors. Folder boundaries create natural access paths for different audiences.

**Why is the open-source strategy buried?**  
It is intentional. GPMAS is proprietary software. The open-source strategy is an exploratory future consideration, not a current direction. It is accessible for strategic review but not promoted to avoid misrepresentation of the project's licensing status.

**Why are legal files segmented?**  
Each legal document serves a distinct function: Terms govern usage, Privacy governs data, License governs IP, AUP governs behavior. Segmentation enables targeted review, targeted updates, and clear legal responsibility boundaries.
