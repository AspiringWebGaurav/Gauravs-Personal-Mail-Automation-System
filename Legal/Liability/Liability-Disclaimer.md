## 1. General Disclaimer

GPMAS is provided **"as is"** and **"as available"** without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The Owner makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, suitability, or availability of the Service, its associated documentation, or any information, products, or services contained within.

---

## 2. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

- **No indirect damages** — The Owner shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from or relating to the use of GPMAS
- **No data loss liability** — The Owner shall not be liable for any loss of data, regardless of cause
- **No business loss liability** — The Owner shall not be liable for any loss of profits, business, or revenue
- **Aggregate cap** — Total liability shall not exceed the amount paid by the user for the Service (which is zero for current deployment)

## 3. Third-Party Service Disclaimer

GPMAS relies on third-party services for critical functionality:

| Service | Provider | GPMAS Liability |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Email delivery** | Third-party email providers | Not liable for provider outages, delivery failures, or quota enforcement |
| **Authentication** | Google Identity Platform | Not liable for authentication service availability or security |
| **Database** | Cloud Firestore | Not liable for data storage availability or durability |
| **Hosting** | Edge network platform | Not liable for hosting availability or network security |

The Owner does not control, endorse, or accept responsibility for any third-party service, and no warranty is made regarding their performance, reliability, or security.

---

## 4. Email Delivery Disclaimer

The Owner specifically disclaims any guarantee of email delivery. Email transmission involves multiple external factors beyond the system's control:

- Recipient mail server acceptance policies
- Spam filter classifications
- Network routing and availability
- Provider-side rate limiting and quota enforcement
- DNS resolution and domain reputation

GPMAS provides **best-effort delivery** through intelligent multi-provider routing. This is not, and should not be interpreted as, a guarantee of delivery.

---

## 5. Force Majeure

The Owner shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance resulting from causes beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to: acts of God, natural disasters, pandemic, war, terrorism, government actions, network failures, power outages, or third-party service disruptions.
