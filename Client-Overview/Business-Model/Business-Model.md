## Current Model (V1)

GPMAS V1 operates as a **privately owned, single-tenant platform** designed and maintained by a sole proprietor. It is not a commercial product and is not offered as a service.

## Cost Structure

| Component | Cost Model | Current Status |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Frontend hosting** | Free tier (edge network) | Active |
| **Database** | Free tier (Cloud Firestore) | Active; monitored by Burn Monitor |
| **Authentication** | Free tier (Google Identity) | Active |
| **Email delivery** | Free tier (EmailJS multi-provider) | Active; quota-managed |
| **Domain** | Annual registration | Active |

### Sustainability Principle
GPMAS is designed to operate entirely within free-tier boundaries. The Burn Monitor provides predictive forecasting to ensure resource consumption remains sustainable.

---

## Revenue Model

GPMAS V1 does not generate revenue. It is a private productivity tool.

### Future Considerations
| Model | Feasibility | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Freemium SaaS** | Medium | Requires multi-tenant architecture (V2+) |
| **Enterprise licensing** | Medium | Requires customization and support infrastructure |
| **Open-source with premium support** | High | Compatible with current architecture |
| **Consulting/integration services** | High | Leverage expertise without platform changes |

## Intellectual Property Value

The primary asset of GPMAS is its **intellectual property**:
- Production-grade multi-provider email routing architecture
- Intelligent failure recovery and retry system
- Complete observability framework
- Comprehensive legal and compliance documentation
- Defensive design patterns and engineering methodology
