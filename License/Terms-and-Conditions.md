## 6. External Provider Disclaimer

### 6.1 Third-Party Dependencies
The Service relies on third-party email delivery providers to transmit email communications. The Owner does not control, operate, or guarantee the availability, reliability, performance, or uptime of any third-party service.

### 6.2 Provider Limitations
- Email delivery speed depends on the third-party provider's infrastructure
- Daily sending quotas are imposed by third-party providers, not by GPMAS
- Provider outages, rate limiting, or service changes are beyond the Owner's control

### 6.3 No Delivery Guarantee
While GPMAS is engineered for maximum reliability through multi-provider routing and automatic failover, the Owner does **not guarantee** that any specific email will be successfully delivered. Email delivery is inherently dependent on factors outside the Owner's control, including recipient mail server configurations, spam filters, and third-party provider availability.
