## 4. Email Handling

### How Emails Are Processed
- GPMAS queues email messages and dispatches them through registered third-party email delivery providers
- Email content and recipient information are transmitted to the selected provider solely for the purpose of delivery
- Once an email is dispatched, the delivery is handled by the third-party provider's infrastructure

### What We Store
- Email recipient address (for tracking and audit purposes)
- Email subject and template used (for audit purposes)
- Delivery status (sent, failed, pending)
- Provider used and response time

### What We Do NOT Store
- The full rendered HTML body of sent emails is not permanently retained after delivery
- Provider API keys are stored securely and are never exposed in logs or audit records

---

## 5. Data Sharing

### No Data Selling
**We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer personal information to any third party for any purpose.**

### Limited Sharing
We share information only in the following limited circumstances:

- **Email Delivery Providers:** Recipient email addresses and email content are shared with the registered email delivery service solely for the purpose of sending the email. No other data is shared with providers.
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law, regulation, subpoena, or court order.

---

## 6. Data Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect and process, including:

- Authentication restricted to a single pre-authorized account
- API-level authorization enforcement at every endpoint
- Cryptographic hashing of sensitive tokens (invitation links are hashed before storage)
- Atomic database transactions to prevent data corruption
- Distributed locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent access conflicts
- No public API endpoints — all APIs are internal to the application

---

## 7. Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention Period |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Event Data** | Retained until the owner deletes the event |
| **Invitation Records** | Retained until the associated event is deleted |
| **Send Logs** | Retained for operational monitoring; subject to periodic cleanup |
| **Audit Records** | Retained indefinitely for compliance and accountability |
| **Provider Configuration** | Retained until the owner removes the provider |

The owner has full control over their data and can delete events, invitations, and providers at any time.
