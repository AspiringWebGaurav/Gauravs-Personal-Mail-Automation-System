# GPMAS — Ethical Communication Policy

> **Version:** 1.0 · **Classification:** Policy  
> **Last Updated:** February 2026

---

## Foundation

GPMAS exists to facilitate professional, consensual communication. Every email sent through the system carries the reputation of its owner and reflects the platform's values. This policy codifies the ethical standards that govern all communications.

## Ethical Principles

### 1. Consent
Communications are only sent to individuals who have a legitimate reason to receive them. The system's invitation model inherently supports this — recipients must be explicitly added and invitation acceptance is voluntary.

### 2. Transparency
Every email clearly identifies:
- Who is sending the communication
- What platform is facilitating the delivery
- How to identify the sender (branding and attribution)

Hidden or disguised sender identity is antithetical to the platform's design.

### 3. Honesty
Email subject lines and content must accurately represent their purpose. Deceptive practices — clickbait subjects, misleading content, false urgency — are prohibited.

### 4. Respect
The recipient's time, attention, and autonomy are respected:
- Communications serve a clear purpose
- Volume is proportionate to need
- Non-response is accepted without escalation

### 5. Accountability
Every communication is traceable through the audit trail. The system owner accepts full responsibility for all communications sent through their GPMAS instance.

## Platform-Level Enforcement

| Principle | How the Platform Enforces It |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Consent** | Invitation-based model; no cold outreach capability |
| **Transparency** | Branded email headers and footers on every message |
| **Honesty** | Template system with variable interpolation (no dynamic deception) |
| **Respect** | One invitation per recipient per event; expiry limits follow-up pressure |
| **Accountability** | Immutable audit trail of every operation |
