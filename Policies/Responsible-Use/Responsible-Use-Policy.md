---

## Responsible Use Principles

### 1. Consent-Based Communication
All emails sent through GPMAS must be directed to recipients who have a legitimate reason to receive them. This includes:
- Individuals explicitly invited to events
- Professional contacts with an established relationship
- Recipients who have consented to communication

**Unsolicited mass communications are strictly prohibited.**

### 2. Truthful Representation
All email content must:
- Accurately identify the sender
- Truthfully represent the purpose of communication
- Not contain misleading subject lines or deceptive content
- Not impersonate other individuals or organizations

### 3. Proportionate Volume
Email volume must be proportionate to legitimate need:
- Provider quotas exist for a reason — respect them
- Sending large volumes in short timeframes may indicate misuse
- Test sends should use Simulation Mode, not live delivery

### 4. Recipient Respect
Recipients' autonomy must be respected:
- Invitation acceptance is voluntary — do not pressure or coerce
- Do not repeatedly send invitations to individuals who have not responded
- Remove invalid or unresponsive email addresses

### 5. Data Stewardship
The system owner bears responsibility for the data they input:
- Verify email addresses before creating invitations
- Do not store unnecessary personal information
- Delete event data when it is no longer needed

## Compliance Expectation

The system owner is responsible for ensuring their use of GPMAS complies with applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to:
- Anti-spam legislation (CAN-SPAM, CASL, GDPR, PECR)
- Data protection regulations
- Electronic communication laws in their jurisdiction
